Introduction
============
This project contains code that provides an implementation of the Jenkin-Traub Algorithm. 

This algorithm is a faster than Newton method for finding the roots of polynomials. It can handle complex coefficients and roots and does not suffer from stability issues. 

For an overview of the algorithm, the Wikipedia Algorithm is a good starting point. More complete details can be found in the original Paper published by Jenkins and Traub in 1969.
